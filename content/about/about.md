    <p>Hey,this is <strong>Tianlin</strong>,a Marie Curie PhD Fellow working at Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH in Hannover, Germany.</p>
    
    <p>Since Nov 2018 I've moved to Lower Saxony in Germany. Maintaining a blog, keeping myself busy in reading, writing, and exercising are the ambitions of my 25s.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Little Saxony Tales</strong> is a sequel to my previous blog <a href="https://www.kth.se/blogs/molecular/">This Stop, Stockholm </a>, during my two wonderful years as KTH blogger in Sweden. </p>
    
    <p>Now the "Nordic Diary" closes, but a new one full of colorful tales opens.</p>
    
    <p>And I will continuely be your faithful story teller.</p>
